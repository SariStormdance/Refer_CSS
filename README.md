## CSS Reference Website Assignment

### Create a multi-page, two column layout website for the following CSS Rules:

background
&emsp; background-color
&emsp; background-image	
&emsp; und-position
&emsp; und-repeat

border
&emsp; border-width
&emsp; border-style
&emsp; border-color

clear
color
display
float
font
&emsp; font-style
&emsp; font-variant
&emsp; font-weight
&emsp; font-size
&emsp; font-family

height
letter-spacing
line-height
list-style
&emsp; list-style-type
&emsp; list-style position
&emsp; list-style-image

margin
opacity
overflow
padding
text-align

text-decoration
text-indent
text-transform
width
 
Provide a definition, some common values, and examples for each rule. Shorthand rules like background should be included on the same page as their related properties. Since this website is intended to be a personal reference for your future use, you may add more rules and or pages as needed, but for the purposes of the assignment, your website will have a minimum of 20 html pages and one external CSS stylesheet. Be sure and validate all pages to help reduce syntax errors.
