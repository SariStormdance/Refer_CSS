## CSS Reference Website Assignment

### Create a multi-page, two column layout website for the following CSS Rules:

background
background-color
background-image
background-position
background-repeat
border
border-width
border-style
border-color
clear
color
display
float
font
font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font-size
font-family
height
letter-spacing
line-height
list-style
list-style-type
list-style position
list-style-image
margin
opacity
overflow
padding
text-align
text-decoration
text-indent
text-transform
width
 
Provide a definition, some common values, and examples for each rule. Shorthand rules like background should be included on the same page as their related properties. Since this website is intended to be a personal reference for your future use, you may add more rules and or pages as needed, but for the purposes of the assignment, your website will have a minimum of 20 html pages and one external CSS stylesheet. Be sure and validate all pages to help reduce syntax errors.
